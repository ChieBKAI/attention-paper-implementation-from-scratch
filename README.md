# attention-paper-implementation-from-scratch
This README provides an overview and guidance for implementing the "Attention is All You Need" paper by Vaswani et al. (2017). The paper introduces the Transformer architecture, a model based solely on self-attention mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art results in various natural language processing tasks.

# Introduction
The Transformer model introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" is a revolutionary neural network architecture that relies on the self-attention mechanism. This implementation aims to provide a clear and concise codebase for understanding and applying the Transformer model.

# Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
